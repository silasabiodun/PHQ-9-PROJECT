  <p>The PHQ-9 is one module of the Patient Health Questionnaire and has nine questions that are simple and short.
    These questions were designed to help healthcare professionals identify signs or symptoms of depression</p>
<p>The scientists namely, Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, Dr. Janet B.W. Williams, and Dr. Kurt Kroenke developed PHP first in the mid-1990s then
  PHP-Q in 1999. It was only in 2001 did PHQ-9 get introduced into the primary health settings.</p>
<p id="Components">This questionnaire comprises of the same criteria used in the diagnosis of depression under the current "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-5) and
  include:</p>
1. Feeling depressed or irritable.<br>
2. Loss of interest or loss of pleasure in doing things.<br>
3. Overeating or loss of appetite.<br>
4. Sleep issues (either sleeping too much or trouble falling or staying asleep)<br>
5. Moving or speaking slowly, or the opposite, speaking quickly or being fidgety</br>
6. Feeling fatigued or lacking energy</br>
7. Feeling like a failure, or that you have disappointed your family or yourself</br>
8. Difficulty concentrating, such as when watching TV or reading a news app<br>
9. Thinking you'd be better off dead or wishing you could hurt yourself somehow</br>
  <p id="Uses">About the uses of PHQ-9, the PHQ-9 may be a component of a full psychiatric screening process that evaluates all areas of mental health.
    The full three-page PHQ assessment is used by some practitioners to assess whether certain mental health issues may be causing or increasing a patient's physical health concerns.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at depression, the complete PHQ asks about alcohol use, anxiety, and eating behaviors.﻿﻿ Patients' answers can help identify potential issues in these areas.</p>
