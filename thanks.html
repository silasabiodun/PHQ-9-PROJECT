  <p>Scoring for each of the nine PHQ-9 questions (or statements) ranges from zero points to three points,
     depending on the answer. These scores are assigned as follows:</p></br>

<p>Not at all: 0 points</p>
<p>Several days: 1 point</p>
<p>More than half of the days: 2 points</p>
<p>Almost all of the days: 3 points</p>
The total score is calculated and can range from zero to 27. What does your score mean?

A score of 20 or higher indicates that severe major depression likely exists and a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy (therapeutic counseling) may be the best treatment approach.
Scoring between 15 and 19 suggests that there is possibly moderately severe major depression, and either antidepressants or psychotherapy would likely be appropriate.
Scoring between 10 and 14 means that you may have a moderate severity depression, with numbers in this range generally leading to recommendations for medication or psychotherapy.
A score between 5 and 9 reveals that mild symptoms of depression appear to exist, which might warrant closer observation and re-evaluation after a certain period of time.
